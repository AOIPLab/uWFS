# Incorporating more threads

The working, stable version of the components directory (../components) has a very simple threading model. The Mirror and Sensor objects are not threads, and they are controlled serially. This has some important advantages--the system is stable, there are no ambiguities about the order in which the wavefront is sensed and a correction is sent to the mirror, and others. However, it has disadvantages for one application--using the mirror for speckle modulation. In this application, random patterns are sent to the mirror at speeds much higher than the AO loop (kHz vs Hz) while the AO loop is running. The best way to accomplish this would have a separate mirror thread which continually sends a compound signal (correction + speckle) to the DM, the correction component of which is modified at the AO loop rate. This directory contains a working version of the latter implementation, but there are undiagnosed issues with thread safety and stability.
